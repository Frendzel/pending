Pending is a JUnit rule and annotation for marking tests as pending. A pending 
test is expected to fail. Should the test pass the unexpected success will be
reported.  

Add the @Pending annotation to either a test class or method to mark tests as 
pending.

Example:

    @PendingImplementation
    public class MyTest {
        @Rule public MethodRule pendingRule = new PendingRule();
        
        /* Failing test methods */
        ...
    }
    
    public class MyTest {
        @Rule public MethodRule pendingRule = new PendingRule();
        
        @PendingImplementation
        @Test public void
        testMethod() {
            /* Failing test */
            ...
        }
    }

The @Pending annotation takes an optional default parameter if you want to
record why a test is marked as pending.  

Example:
    Code:
        public class MyTest {
           @Rule public MethodRule pendingRule = PendingRule.withOutput();
           
           @PendingImplementation("Work in progress")
           @Test public void
           testMethod() {
                /* Failing test */
                ...
           }
        }
