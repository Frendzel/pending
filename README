Pending is a JUnit rule and annotation for marking tests as pending. A pending
test will not be evaluated.

Add the @Pending annotation to either a test class or method to mark tests as 
pending.

Example:

    @Pending
    public class MyTest {
        @Rule public MethodRule pendingRule = new PendingRule();
        
        ...
    }
    
    public class MyTest {
        @Rule public MethodRule pendingRule = new PendingRule();
        
        @Pending
        @Test public void
        testMethod() {
            ...
        }
    }

Use the static constructor PendingRule.withOutput() to print pending test
method names to standard out.

Example:
    Code:
        public class MyTest {
            @Rule public MethodRule pendingRule = PendingRule.withOutput();
            
            @Pending
            @Test public void
            testMethod() {
                ...
            }
        }
        
    Output:
        PENDING TEST: MyTest.testMethod()

The @Pending annotation takes an optional default parameter if you want to
record why a test is marked as pending.  

Example:
    Code:
        public class MyTest {
           @Rule public MethodRule pendingRule = PendingRule.withOutput();
           
           @Pending("Work in progress")
           @Test public void
           testMethod() {
               ...
           }
        }
    
    Output:
        PENDING TEST: MyTest.testMethod() [Work in progress]
