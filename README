Pending is a JUnit rule and annotation for marking tests as pending. A pending
test will not be evaluated.

Add the @Pending annotation to either a test class or method to mark tests as 
pending.

Example:

    @Pending
    public class MyTest {
        ...
    }
    
    public class MyTest {
        @Pending
        @Test public void
        testMethod() {
            ...
        }
    }

Tests marked as pending will be printed to sysout.

Example:
    Pending test: MyTest.testMethod()
